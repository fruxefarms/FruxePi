## Extra help :)

This version of the FruxePi is still under development and in prototype. Our goal is to make this application effortless to deploy and run on your Raspberry Pi. However, until we get all the bugs worked out, this project may require the knowledge of an advanced Pi user. Nonetheless, if you are keen on this project and are having issues deploying FruxePi, please create an issue explaining your problem or contact hello@fruxe.co.

## Bug reports

Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

**Example:**

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to preach the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.
